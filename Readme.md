# Description
This is an space ship shooter game  it was made using pygame and python. This game is the final project for my python course. It showcases my skills in programming and game design. The game has scoring, sound effects, lives, and other cool effects that make it fun and challenging to play. The goal of the game is to shoot down as many alien space ships as possible before they reach the bottom of the screen or before you run out of lives. The game has different levels of difficulty and different types of aliens to keep the player engaged.
